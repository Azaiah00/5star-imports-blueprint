### **Step 3: Add OpenAI API Key** ⚠️ CRITICAL STEP

Without this step, the AI playground won't work!

1. In Netlify, stay on your site dashboard
2. Click **"Site configuration"** (in left sidebar)
3. Click **"Environment variables"**
4. Click **"Add a variable"** → **"Add a single variable"**
5. Enter:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Paste your OpenAI API key (from "Before You Start" above)
   - **Scopes**: Leave default (All scopes)
6. Click **"Create variable"**

### **Step 4: Redeploy** ⚠️ CRITICAL STEP

Environment variables only take effect AFTER a redeploy:

1. Click **"Deploys"** (in left sidebar)
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** dropdown
3. Click **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait 30 seconds

---

### **Step 5: Test Your Site**

1. Click **"Open production deploy"** (or visit your Netlify URL)
2. Navigate to **"Interactive AI Tools Playground"** section
3. **Test Marketing Copy Generator**:
   - Car Model: `2023 BMW M4`
   - USP: `Low mileage, ceramic coating`
   - Click **"Generate Ad Copy"**
   - Wait 2-3 seconds
   - Should show professional ad copy! ✅

4. **Test Email Generator**:
   - Context: `Lead John wants info on 2021 Porsche Cayenne financing`
   - Click **"Generate Follow-up Email"**
   - Should show personalized email! ✅

If both work, you're done! 🎉

## 🐛 If AI Doesn't Work

### Checklist:
- [ ] Did you add `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Netlify environment variables?
- [ ] Did you **redeploy** after adding the key? (Step 4)
- [ ] Is your OpenAI API key valid? Test at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [ ] Do you have credits in your OpenAI account?
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for error messages

### Quick Fix:
1. Go to Netlify → Site configuration → Environment variables
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is there with correct value
3. Go to Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy site
4. Wait 30 seconds and test again

## 💡 Understanding the Setup

### **You DON'T need a .env file because:**

```
CLIENT TESTS:
┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │
│   Browser   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ visits
       ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Netlify Live Site  │
│ (your-site.netlify) │
└──────┬──────────────┘
       │ serverless function reads
       ↓
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Netlify Env Variables    │ ← SET IN DASHBOARD
│ OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...    │
└──────┬───────────────────┘
       │ uses to call
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│  OpenAI API  │
└──────────────┘
```

The API key is stored **on Netlify's servers**, not in your code!

## 🎯 What the Client Will See

When the client visits your Netlify URL, they'll experience:

✅ Professional single-page blueprint

```bash
# Make changes to your files
# Then:
git add .
